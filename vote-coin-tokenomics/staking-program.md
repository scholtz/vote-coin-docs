How does it calculate? Tinyman provides shares of the pool using pool created ASA, for example [553838965](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/553838965) and [553854066](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/553854066). Each hour we check balance of each holder at these pools which is the share of the pool. For example account ABC has share 1%. At the same round, the pool has for example 1 000 000 $vote on its account, so the account ABC owns 10 000 $vote. From the 10 000 $vote, account ABC will receive 50% pa in hourly base.

To add a liquidity to the AMM pool, select pool which you want to use and follow basic workflow.
