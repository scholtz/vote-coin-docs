### AMM staking incentive program

Each hour everyone who owns share at the official AMM liquidity pools will receive **50% p.a.** of his $vote amount in the shared pool. Maximum effective balance per account is 1 000 000 $vote.

How does it calculate? Tinyman provides shares of the pool using pool created ASA, for example [553838965](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/553838965) and [553854066](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/553854066). Each hour we check balance of each holder at these pools which is the share of the pool. For example account ABC has share 1%. At the same round, the pool has for example 1 000 000 $vote on its account, so the account ABC owns 10 000 $vote. From the 10 000 $vote, account ABC will receive 50% pa in hourly base.&#x20;
